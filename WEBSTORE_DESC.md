## 🌟 New Features

### 🎥 Macro Recorder (NEW!)
Struggling with complex forms, dynamic menus, or "smart" search fields (like React/Vue dropdowns)? 
*   **Record:** Click "Record", perform your actions (click, type, select), and stop.
*   **Replay:** The plugin will repeat your exact steps automatically when the form appears.
*   **Smart Wait:** The macro waits for elements to become visible before running, ensuring stability on slow-loading pages.

### ☁️ Cloud Sync & Backup (NEW!)
*   **Google Drive & OneDrive Support:** Backup your rules to your personal cloud storage.
*   **Sync:** Keep your rules synchronized across multiple computers.
*   **Manual Control:** You decide when to push or pull data. No hidden background syncing.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Flexible Matching:** Match sites by Hostname, Domain, exact URL, or Regex.
*   **Precise Targeting:** Target fields by `name`, `id`, `data-attributes`, `placeholder`, or CSS Selectors.
*   **Profiles:** Switch easily between "Work", "Personal", or "Testing" profiles.
*   **Variables:** Define global variables (e.g., `{email}`, `{phone}`) to update multiple rules at once.
*   **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally on your device (unless you explicitly use Cloud Backup). No tracking, no ads.
*   **Developer Friendly:** "Force Fill" mode to bypass checks, and detailed debug logging.
