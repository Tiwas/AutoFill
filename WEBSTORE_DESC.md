*   **Multiple Profiles:** seamlessly switch between "Personal", "Work", or "Testing" profiles to keep your data organized.
*   **Regex Support:** Use the full power of Regular Expressions for both site matching and field identification.
*   **Variables:** Define global variables (like `{email}` or `{phone}`) to update multiple rules instantly.
*   **Privacy First:** 100% Local. Your data is stored securely in your browser. No cloud sync, no tracking, no external servers.
*   **Import/Export:** Easily backup your rules or share them via CSV.

**🛠️ Perfect for:**
