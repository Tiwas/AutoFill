AutoFill Plugin - The Ultimate Form Automation Tool (Beta)

AutoFill Plugin is a powerful, privacy-focused browser extension designed to automate form filling on websites. Whether you're a developer testing forms, a power user filling out repetitive data, or just want to save time, AutoFill has you covered.

⚠️ BETA NOTICE & COMMUNITY REQUEST ⚠️

This plugin is a free, open-source hobby project developed in my spare time. It is currently in Beta.

Before giving a low rating: If you encounter a bug or a feature doesn't work as expected (e.g., a specific website isn't filling correctly), please contact me or open an issue on GitHub.

Negative ratings discourage development. Constructive feedback, bug reports, and code contributions help keep this project alive and free for everyone!
